## Introduction
A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) consists of two neural networks:

Generator: It generates fake images.
Discriminator: It tries to distinguish between real and fake images.
These two networks are trained simultaneously in a way that the generator gets better at creating fake images, and the discriminator gets better at detecting fake images. Over time, the generator produces increasingly realistic images.

This implementation uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- Torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing images)


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gan-image-generation.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```sh
cd gan-image-generation
```
3. **Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
```sh
python -m venv gan_project_env
source gan_project_env/bin/activate     # For Linux/Mac
gan_project_env\Scripts\activate        # For Windows
```
4. **Install the required libraries:**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Or, install manually:**
```sh
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

└── README.md            # Project documentation
```
## Usage
1. **Run the GAN training:**
```sh
python gan.py
```
The training will start, and during each epoch, fake images will be generated and saved in the images/ directory.

2. **Monitor the progress:**

After every epoch, the generated images will be saved in the images directory in PNG format. The losses for the discriminator (d_loss) and generator (g_loss), along with discriminator scores, will also be printed on the terminal.

## Results
The generated images from the GAN will be saved in the images/ directory, and you can view the progression of the image generation as the epochs increase.

After sufficient training epochs, the generator will be able to create realistic images that resemble the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Future Work
- Improve the model architecture for better image quality.
- Implement training on more complex datasets.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
